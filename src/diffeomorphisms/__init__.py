class Diffeomorphism(nn.Module):
    """ 
    Base class describing a diffeomorphism phi: R^d -> R^d. 

    This class provides a template for defining transformations 
    that are diffeomorphisms, i.e., smooth bijections with smooth 
    inverses. It includes methods for forward and inverse transformations, 
    as well as their differentials. 

    Attributes:
        d (tuple): Dimension of one element in the batch. For Euclidean data, 
                   this is a single integer (the dimensionality of the data).
                   For image data, this should be a tuple (c, h, w) representing 
                   the number of channels, height, and width.
